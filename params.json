{"name":"Java-gravity-simulator","tagline":"A gravity simulator ","body":"Java-Gravity-Simulator\r\n======================\r\n\r\nA gravity simulator inspired by (this)[http://nowykurier.com/toys/gravity/gravity.html]\r\n\r\nDownload here\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n- Left click to place a particle.\r\n- Right click near a particle to select it.\r\n- Middle click and drag to move the viewport.\r\n- Hold shift while placing a particle to make that particle static.\r\n- There is a menu in the left right corner that show the currently selected mouse wheel behaviour.\r\n\r\nKeyboard shortcuts:\r\n\r\n- S: invert selected particle's static flag.\r\n- V: change selected particle's velocity, click or press v again to finalize.\r\n- M: move selected particle, click or press g again to finalize.\r\n- F: freeze time.\r\n- C: clear all particles.\r\n- 1-9: select mouse wheel menu 1-9.\r\n- 0: select mouse wheel menu 10.\r\n- +: speed up time.\r\n- -: slow down time. **WARNING** _this seems to mess everything up if it goes below .25x speed_\r\n- Escape: cancel velocity/position editing.\r\n- Backspace: delete selected particle.\r\n\r\nIf you want to export this as a runnable jar, (this)[http://thecodinguniverse.com/lwjgl-exporting-as-jar/] works;\r\n\r\nThis doesn't include the .classpath file, because it is platform specific, so here is how to set yours up.\r\n\r\nEclipse:\r\n\r\n1.  Right click the project in the Package Explorer\r\n2.  Click on Properties\r\n3.  Select Java Build path\r\n4.  Click Add JARS...\r\n5.  Go to <Project name> -> lib -> jars -> lwjgl.jar\r\n6.  Click Add JARS... again\r\n7.  Go to <Project name> -> lib -> slick.jar\r\n\r\nNow we are going to add the natives\r\n\r\n8.  Open up the lwjgl.jar entry\r\n9.  Select Native Library Location\r\n10.  Click Edit...\r\n11.  Click Workspace...\r\n12.  Select <Project name> -> lib -> native -> <Your OS>\r\n13.  Click OK until you get out of the Properties window\r\n\r\nYou are done!\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n  no idea\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
